====== Custom Ressource Definition ======
[[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/|CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) API]]

A resource is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind; for example, the built-in pods resource contains a collection of Pod objects.
A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not necessarily available in a default Kubernetes installation. It represents a customization of a particular Kubernetes installation. However, many core Kubernetes functions are now built using custom resources, making Kubernetes more modular.
