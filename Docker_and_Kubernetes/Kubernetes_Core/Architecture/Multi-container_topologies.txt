====== Multi-container topologies ======
**This terminology just helps expressing a need.**

===== Sidecar =====
A sidecar is a secondary container which helps or provides a service not found in the primary application. Logging containers are a common sidecar (fluentd is a very common choice).
Sidecar are often configured with a ConfigMap.

===== Ambassador =====
It is used to communicate with outside resources, often outside the cluster. Using a proxy, like Envoy or HAproxy, you can embed a proxy instead of using one provided by the cluster. It is helpful if you are unsure of the cluster configuration.

===== Adapter =====
This type of secondary container is useful to modify the data generated by the primary container. For example, the Microsoft version of ASCII is distinct from everyone else. You may need to modify a datastream for proper use.
