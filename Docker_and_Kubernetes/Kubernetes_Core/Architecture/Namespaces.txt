====== Namespaces ======
To partition the cluster into virtual sub-clusters.
**This feature does NOT provides any security by itself!**

**DNS**
* ''foo'': foo service in the same namespace
* ''foo.bar.srv.cluster.local'': foo service in bar namespace

**Default namespaces**
* The ''kube-system'' Namespace contains the objects created by the Kubernetes system, mostly the control plane agents.
* The ''default'' Namespace contains the objects and resources created by administrators and developers. 
* The ''kube-public'' Namespace is unsecured and readable by anyone. It is used for special purposes such as exposing public (non-sensitive) information about the cluster.
* The ''kube-node-lease'' Namespace holds node lease objects used for node heartbeat data.

**Not All Objects are in a Namespace**
namespace resources are not themselves in a namespace. And low-level resources, such as nodes and persistentVolumes, are not in any namespace.
