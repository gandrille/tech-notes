====== Autoscaling ======
Uses a controller to monitor ssth (CPU, memory,...) and act accordingly.

[[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/|Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)]]
HPA is an algorithm based controller API resource which automatically adjusts the number of replicas in a ReplicaSet, Deployment or Replication Controller based on CPU utilization.

[[https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/autoscaling/vertical-pod-autoscaler.md|Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)]]
VPA automatically sets Container resource requirements (CPU and memory) in a Pod and dynamically adjusts them in runtime, based on historical utilization data, current resource availability and real-time events.

[[https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler|Cluster Autoscaler]]
Cluster Autoscaler automatically re-sizes the Kubernetes cluster when there are insufficient resources available for new Pods expecting to be scheduled or when there are underutilized nodes in the cluster.
