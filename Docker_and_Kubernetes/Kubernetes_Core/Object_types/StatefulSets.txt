====== StatefulSets ======
[[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/|Documentation]]

**Provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.**

The StatefulSet controller is used for stateful applications which require a unique identity, such as name, network identifications, strict ordering, etc. For example, MySQL cluster, etcd cluster.

A StatefulSet can be used to deploy pods in a particular order, such that following pods are only deployed if previous pods report a ready status.
