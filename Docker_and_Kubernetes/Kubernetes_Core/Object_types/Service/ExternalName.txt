====== ExternalName ======
[[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname|Documentation]]

ExternalName is a special ServiceType, that has no Selectors and does not define any endpoints. When accessed within the cluster, it returns a CNAME record of an externally configured Service.

The primary use case of this ServiceType is to make externally configured Services like my-database.example.com available to applications inside the cluster. If the externally defined Service resides within the same Namespace, using just the name my-database would make it available to other applications and Services within that same Namespace.
