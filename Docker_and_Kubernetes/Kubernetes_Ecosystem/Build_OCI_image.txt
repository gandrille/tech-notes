**What it does**
* Orchestrates the image build using Docker, Docker buildx, buildpack (pack), BuildKit CLI for kubectl, [[https://ko.build/|Ko]], [[https://bazel.build/|Bazel]],...
* Finds the immutable tag (resolved image tag) of the container image
* Pushes image to a container registry if you wish (not necessary for local dev)
* Modifies the configuration withe the appropriate immutable (hash) tag (k8s, swarm, CircleCI, Tekton,...). Can be done for third party as well
â†’ more robust than using sed, yq, and others...
