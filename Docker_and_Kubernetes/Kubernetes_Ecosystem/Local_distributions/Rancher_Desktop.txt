====== Rancher Desktop ======
https://rancherdesktop.io/

===== FEATURE 1: Local Kubernetes cluster =====
[[https://rancherdesktop.io/|Rancher Desktop]] uses [[https://lima-vm.io/|Lima]]. This VM runs everything :
* [[https://k3s.io/|k3s]] with [[https://containerd.io/|containerd]] â†’ Kubernetes version can be selected to match prod!
* [[https://traefik.io/traefik/|Traefik]], for the ingress

===== FEATURE 2: GUI =====
Out of the box.
(Minikube does not provides this out of the box)

===== FEATURE 3: Manage container images (build,...) =====
Since Rancher can replace Docker, [[https://github.com/rancher/kim|Kim (Kubernetes Image Manager)]] can be used in order to build and manage container images, evenif Kim is still a bit green.

Note: in order to build container images inside Kubernetes, Kim is gread in dev... but [[https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko|Kaniko]] is preferable for prod.
