**Connect**
* Put the laptop inside the cluster
* Makes remote local
→ This way, using a PostgreSQL client, it is possible to troubleshoot a PostgreSQL server inside the cluster.

**Intercept**
* Using a side car container using envoy proxy (and a traffic manager inside the cluster)
→ Now, all requests to a given pod (or pods, inside a deployment) are redirrected to the developper laptop... and the developper can catch the request inside his IDE.
→ no need anymore to compile, build the image, push it to the registry, update the yaml, apply ☺

**Advanced features**
* Personal intercept : 
* Mirror pod files locally (called mount volumes)
* Copy env variables to the local machine
* ...
 
**Releases**
* v1: proxy used to fully replace a microservice
* v2: envoy proxy injected as a sidecar
