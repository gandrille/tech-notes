* security, mutual TLS
* observability
* and more...

===== Actual landscape =====
**How it works**
admission controller with policy â†’ side-car injection! a container is inserted int every single pod.

* [[https://istio.io|Istio]] (Google) : Istio trademarks were donated to the Open Usage Commons. Injects an [[https://www.envoyproxy.io|Envoy proxy]] in every pod.
* [[https://linkerd.io/|Linkerd ]](CNCF project) lightweigh, minimized, service mesh
* [[https://www.consul.io|Consul]] (HashiCorp) : GA for managed-Consul on AKS -- fully configured for "production".
* [[https://openservicemesh.io/|Open Service Mesh]] (Microsoft) : based on the popular and powerful Envoy proxy

Customize Envoy Proxy with WebAssembly
Simply and securely extend Envoy Proxy, Gloo API gateway and Istio service mesh with a Wasm module in the language of your choice.

===== Cilium and eBPF as a game changer ? =====
https://cilium.io
"Cilium is an open source software for providing, securing and observing network connectivity between container workloads - cloud native, and fueled by the revolutionary Kernel technology eBPF."

Today, popular service mesh such as [[https://linkerd.io/|Linkerd]] and [[https://istio.io/latest/about/service-mesh/|Istio]] are using sidecar. For instance Istio is using the popular [[https://www.envoyproxy.io/|Envoy proxy]]. The drawback of this approach is that it adds a lot of ressources (one sidecar per pod !) which is... bad.

eBPF is a new approach in order to do the same without sidecars. And cilium is a service mesh that implements this approch. It provides as well [[https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/hubble_intro/|Hubble]], a nice interface for observability.

**Take aways**
* eBPF may be a game changer
* keep an eye on Cilium... and its policy engine
* Cilim is not only a service mesh... but this is what it is known to be
