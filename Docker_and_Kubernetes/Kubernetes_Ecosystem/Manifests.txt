====== Manifests ======
* Kustomize: not well for distributing applications  
* Helm: the defacto standard for defining applications
* Carvel ytt:   
* Jsonnet Tanka: not that easy...
* cdk8s: manifest generated using code (Java, Python,...) → code 2 YAML
→ not that easy to say, depends on usecases

===== Helm vs Kustomize =====
**Approach**
* Helm: templating mechanism (placeholders and values)
* Kustomize: patching mechanism → base definitions patched

**Customization**
* Helm is more intuitive and easy for end users
* Kustomize can be... fully customized, even if this was not planned. This is nice... and be a mess.

**Complexity**
* Helm is easier (perfect if you are a dev)
* Kustomize is harder (great if you are a sys ops)

**Third pary app**
* Helm: use it if the helm chart provide all the customization points you need
* Kustomize: use it if you need to customize ssth specific
