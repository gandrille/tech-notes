====== Kustomize ======
https://kustomize.io
[[https://youtu.be/QwU3JmjyKoM?t=1134|5 minutes intro]]
Comes with kubectl


YAML overwrites based on overlays

Kustomize only works with kubernetes yaml files... To work with any kind of files, have a look at [[https://carvel.dev/ytt/|Carvel ytt]], a templating and patch engine (does both !)

Tool to customize Kubernetes resources using patches, not templates (â‰  Helm).
The advantage is that placeholders don't need to be defined up front.

* **Base :** original set of kubernetes manifests
* **Patch :** changes to be applied
* **Overlay :** result achieved after a patch is applied

It's a good practice to have fine grained patches that are going to be combined.

===== Transformers =====
Some updates are quite common : updating the number of replicas, the image name,...
For this, transformers can create a patch for you.

**Works using CLI**
''kustomize edit set image monopole/hello:1=monopole/hello:latest''
''kustomize build .''

===== Generators =====
To generate configmaps, secrets and... helm charts.
''kustomize edit add secret sl-demo-app --from-literal=db-password=12345''
