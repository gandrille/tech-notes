====== Liquibase ======
Database schema management
Supports 53 databases !

**Who is Liquibase / What we do**
* Liquibase helps teams release software faster by bringing DevOps to the database
* Build applications faster
* Collaborate freely with your full team
* Remove the manual, mindless tasks that keep you from innovating
* Deliver continuously with full confidence and safety
* Reduce friction for teams that depend on each other to deliver
* Limit tradeoffs between speed and stability

**Liquibase and Kubernetes**
* Best Practice: use Liquibase as init container.
* The init container will run Liquibase to update the database schema before the main application container starts.
* We want fast application starts.
* Do NOT run as part of application startup.
â†’ I know, SpringBoot does this by default.
