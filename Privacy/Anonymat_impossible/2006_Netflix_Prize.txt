**The Netflix Prize**

* In October 2006, Netflix launched a $1m prize for an algorithm that was 10% better than its existing algorithm Cinematch
* participants were given access to the contest training data set of more than 100 million ratings from over 480 thousand randomly-chosen, anonymous customers on nearly 18 thousand movie titles. 
* How much information would you need to be able to identify customers?

**Netflix**

* Netflix said “to protect customer privacy, all personal information identifying individual customers has been removed and all customer ids have been replaced by randomly-assigned ids. The date of each rating and the title and year of release for each movie are provided. No other customer or movie information is provided.”
* Two weeks after the prize was launched, Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov of the University of Texas at Austin announced that they could identify a high proportion of the 480,000 subscribers in the training data.

**Narayanan and Shmatikov’s results**

* How much does the attacker need to know about a Netflix subscriber in order to identify her record in the dataset, and thus completely learn her movie viewing history? Very little. 
* For example, suppose the attacker learns a few random ratings and the corresponding dates for some subscriber, perhaps from coffee-time chat.
* With 8 movie ratings (of which we allow 2 to be completely wrong) and dates that may have a 3-day error, 96% of Netflix subscribers whose records have been released can be uniquely identified in the dataset.
* For 64% of subscribers, knowledge of only 2 ratings and dates is sufficient for complete deanonymization, and for 89%, 2 ratings and dates are enough to reduce the set of records to 8 out of almost 500,000, which can then be inspected for further deanonymisation.

**Why are Narayanan and Shmatikov’s results important?**

* They were results from probability theory, so they apply to all sparse datasets. (They tested the results later, using the Internet Movie Database IMDb as a source of data).
* Psychologists at Cambridge University have shown that a small number of seemingly innocuous Facebook Likes can be used to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender).
