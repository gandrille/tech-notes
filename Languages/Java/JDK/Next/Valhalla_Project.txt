====== Valhalla Project ======
**Generic specialization and value types**

“codes like a class, works like an int,” 
The current plan is to introduce two new kinds of types: value classes and primitive classes.

Higher memory desity, better performance of ML and big data apps through the introduction of value types.

**Long term goals**
* value class: state expresses identity
* universal generification: even primitives in generics
