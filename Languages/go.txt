**Go surveys**
* [[https://blog.golang.org/survey2019-results|2019]]
	* Respondents are using Go to solve similar problems, particularly building API/RPC services and CLIs, regardless of the size of organization they work at.
	* Most teams try to update to the latest Go release quickly; when third-party providers are late to support the current Go release, this creates an adoption blocker for developers.
	* Almost everyone in the Go ecosystem is now using modules, but some confusion around package management remains.
	* High-priority areas for improvement include improving the developer experience for debugging, working with modules, and working with cloud services.
	* VS Code and GoLand have continued to see increased use; theyâ€™re now preferred by 3 out of 4 respondents.
* [[https://blog.golang.org/survey2018-results|2018]]
	* The most **common uses for Go remain API/RPC services and CLI tools**. Automation tasks, while not as common as CLI tools and API services, are a fast-growing area for Go.
	* **Web development remains the most common domain** that survey respondents work in, but **DevOps showed the highest year-over-year growth** and is now the second most common domain.
	* **VS Code and GoLand are surging in popularity** and are now the most popular code editors among survey respondents.
	* Survey respondents appear to be **shifting away from on-prem Go deployments** and moving towards containers and serverless cloud deployments.

**Language server**
